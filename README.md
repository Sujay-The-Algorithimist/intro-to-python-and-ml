# Intro to Python and ML

This repo contains my learning notebooks covering:

- 🐍 Python basics (variables, input/output, operations)
- 📊 Data visualization with matplotlib
- 🤖 Machine Learning with scikit-learn (Linear Regression)

It's a part of my journey into Python and Machine Learning. Not a full project — just hands-on practice and learning.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
